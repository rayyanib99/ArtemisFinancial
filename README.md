# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Our cllient, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Their financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API). They are seeking my company, Global Rain’s, expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think one thing I did well to mitigate the client's risk and security vulnerabilities was identify and modify the code through the use of algorithm ciphers and encryption. Coding securely is vital for protecting sensitive data, maintaining user trust and privacy, mitigating vulnerabilities, preventing malicious attacks, complying with legal requirements, and saving costs and time. By prioritizing security throughout the coding process, developers can create robust and resilient software that provides a safe and reliable experience for users. Software security adds value to a company's overall wellbeing by protecting intellectual property, building customer trust, ensuring compliance with regulations, reducing risks and liability, maintaining business continuity, and providing a competitive advantage. By prioritizing software security, companies can safeguard their assets, maintain a positive reputation, and achieve long-term success in an increasingly digital and interconnected world.

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

What I found challenging was the depndency-check report. Initially, I found it to be a bit difficult to comprehend with the different vulnerabilities and false positives present.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I used static testing or the dependency plugin as well as changed the code using encryption mechanisms and ciphers to encrypt the data.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I maven clened, installed, and then ran the code multiple times after refactoring. Also, I supressed false positives as well and used secure HTTPS. Lastly, I kept checking the dependency-check report after every run until the refactored code was successful.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used the maven dependency for static testing as well as the java keytool. Besides that, I used the Eclispse for future coding assignements or work that is a very common IDE in the coding world.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will dmeonstarted my technical writing skills through the two projects completed in this course. I will also show examples of the original and refactored code in Eclipse with the dependency-check report to show my skill in coding securely.
